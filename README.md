 Docker:

https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

**STAGE 9 — PROJECTS (MOST IMPORTANT — 60% focus)**

Beginner:

EDA project

Data cleaning

Datasets:

 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
 

**Intermediate:**

House price prediction
Customer churn


**Advanced:**

Recommendation system
End-to-end ML pipeline

**STAGE 10 — TOOLS**

Learn:

 Git:

https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial

 GitHub:

https://docs.github.com/en/get-started

 Jupyter:

https://jupyter.org/try


**REAL PRO TIPS (Industry Truth)**

Most beginners fail because:

 Too much theory
 Not enough projects
 No GitHub portfolio
 No deployment experience

Real focus:

 30% learning
 70% building projects
